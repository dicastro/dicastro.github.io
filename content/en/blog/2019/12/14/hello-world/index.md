This was my first test post.

The idea of this blog is to gather articles on topics that interest me and keep them handy as a reference. Here I will post notes on new things I’m researching, as well as solutions to problems I have encountered.

I will also share details about some of my side projects and, when possible, write about work situations or experiences that I find interesting, always avoiding revealing sensitive or compromising information.
