This website is built with [Hugo Blox](https://hugoblox.com) and serves as my personal space to showcase my professional background and projects. It includes a web-based version of my résumé, which can also be exported to PDF using *Pandoc* together with the *ModernCV* LaTeX template, ensuring that I maintain full control over an up-to-date and consistent version of my CV.

A key goal of this project is to be the **owner of my professional data**, rather than relying solely on platforms such as LinkedIn or InfoJobs. Here, I can present both my work experience and my personal projects, helping recruiters and companies gain a better understanding of my technical skills and interests.

The site also features a [blog](/en/blog), where I write about programming, 3D printing, and other areas I'm passionate about. Writing articles helps me improve my communication skills—an essential part of my day-to-day work.
