I am a computer engineer with over 15 years of experience, during which I have worked in a wide variety of environments and taken on different roles throughout the development lifecycle. This journey has allowed me to gain a broad understanding of the industry and to adapt easily to different technical and organizational contexts.

I have worked at large multinational consulting firms, participating in projects of various natures and collaborating with teams distributed across multiple countries. I have also experienced working in an early-stage startup, which gave me the opportunity to be involved in building a product from scratch and to gain firsthand insight into the challenges of the business world.

I am passionate about programming and maintain a continuous learning mindset. For me, the key is not mastering a specific language or framework, but the ability to **learn, evolve, and deeply understand problems** in order to provide robust solutions. Along this learning path, I have explored areas such as Data Science and Big Data, completing a master’s program that reflects my interest in broadening my horizons and understanding new technological perspectives.
