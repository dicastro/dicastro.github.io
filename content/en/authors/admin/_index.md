    summary: |
      The Workshop is a product company specialized in gaming, betting, and fintech platforms. The platform serves more than 500,000 daily active users and processes nearly 1,000 operations per second. The backend is multi-brand and multi-tenant, offering shared services for multiple business lines from a single technical ecosystem.

      #### Key Contributions

      - **Backend service optimization:** Improved performance and system stability of the campaign service by refining exclusion logic and centralizing the task queue, preventing pod overload and achieving a more homogeneous workload distribution.
      - **Kubernetes cluster upgrade:** Participated in the upgrade of the corporate cluster to a new version, deploying all product services into a new production environment. Coordinated with DevOps, Network, and Third Parties teams (both integrated with us and integrated by us) in a complex multi-team process.
      - **Support task automation:** Developed an internal tool to automate processes related to *on-call* duties: phone redirection, wiki and messaging channel updates, automatic incident logging and ticket generation, including automatic rotation of the support schedule.
      - **Cross-team collaboration:** Participated in code-cleanup initiatives to remove client-specific dependencies and improve service maintainability, as well as developing tools to analyze code impact across multiple teams.
      - **Creation of a new production environment:** Involved in building a new production environment in an additional datacenter, deploying all services from scratch and managing the transition with controlled downtime.
      - **Innovation and impact:** Contributed to a hackathon project focused on optimizing software licenses, achieving 3rd place company-wide.
      - **Storage optimization:** Designed and executed a database cleanup process in the marketing system, significantly reducing required storage.
      - **Technology migration:** Participated in migrating the marketing system from **Cassandra** to **Elasticsearch**, improving query efficiency and maintainability.
      - **Operational reliability:** Documented complex technical investigations and standardized critical configurations to facilitate stable and reproducible deployments.

      #### Key Achievements

      - Improved campaign execution time by **90–95%** through logic optimization and flow refactoring.
      - Reduced manual effort in on-call operations through full automation of planning and incident management.
      - Supported external teams until full autonomy, improving code quality and delivery efficiency.
      - Key contributor in the corporate Kubernetes upgrade program, resolving dependency and configuration blockers across teams and Third Parties.
      - Reduced marketing system storage consumption by **15%** through data cleanup and optimization processes.
      - Contributed to a hackathon project with an estimated savings of **€300,000/year** in software licensing costs.

---

I am a computer engineer with over 15 years of experience, during which I have worked in a wide variety of environments and taken on different roles throughout the development lifecycle. This journey has allowed me to gain a broad understanding of the industry and to adapt easily to different technical and organizational contexts.

I have worked at large multinational consulting firms, participating in projects of various natures and collaborating with teams distributed across multiple countries. I have also experienced working in an early-stage startup, which gave me the opportunity to be involved in building a product from scratch and to gain firsthand insight into the challenges of the business world.

I am passionate about programming and maintain a continuous learning mindset. For me, the key is not mastering a specific language or framework, but the ability to **learn, evolve, and deeply understand problems** in order to provide robust solutions. Along this learning path, I have explored areas such as Data Science and Big Data, completing a master's program that reflects my interest in broadening my horizons and understanding new technological perspectives.
