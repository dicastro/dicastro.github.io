\begin{justify}
I am particularly drawn to this role by the chance to contribute to a collaborative, innovative engineering culture and to help scale a product that meaningfully improves how companies manage spending. Pleo's emphasis on autonomy, trust, and innovation resonates strongly with the environment in which I thrive.

In my current role, I work on distributed, cloud-native systems built on Kubernetes and microservices. My team develops core backend services that must remain reliable, secure and performant under continuous growth. I have been responsible for designing, evolving and maintaining services that support large user bases, always with a strong focus on code quality, scalability and operational robustness. Although my primary language has been Java, I work daily within the JVM ecosystem and I am fully confident in adopting Kotlin.

Software quality is a key part of my work. I have extensive experience with testing at multiple levels—including unit tests, mutation testing, component tests, contract tests, system tests and end-to-end test suites, using frameworks like JUnit, Pitest, Testcontainers and others. Maintaining a strong testing culture has been essential in ensuring reliability across our microservices and in enabling safe refactoring and migrations.

I also work with observability tools like Prometheus, Micrometer, Alertmanager and Grafana to monitor services, proactively detect errors through alerts and measure and guide performance improvements.

Beyond my core responsibilities, I enjoy contributing to innovation initiatives. I regularly participate in company-wide innovation days and recently took part in our annual "Geek Week", developing and presenting prototype ideas alongside engineers from different teams. I appreciate environments like Pleo where experimentation and creativity are encouraged.

I am also comfortable taking ownership, mentoring teammates and participating in code reviews, technical discussions and post-mortems. Collaboration and knowledge sharing have been central to every team I've been part of, and I look forward to contributing to that culture at Pleo.

I appreciate that Pleo's interview process emphasizes both technical proficiency and cultural fit, that balance matches exactly how I approach engineering. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in backend engineering, distributed systems, testing practices and collaborative problem-solving, together with my alignment with Pleo's values, can contribute to company's mission as it scales globally.
